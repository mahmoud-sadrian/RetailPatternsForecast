\section{Conclusion}

This project implemented association rule mining and time series forecasting entirely 
from scratch. The basket transformation and manual Apriori algorithm revealed several 
frequent itemsets and meaningful product associations. Support, confidence, and lift 
were computed without external libraries, providing insight into the mathematical 
structure of rule mining.

The second part of the project developed a fully manual SES model, which outperformed 
a naive baseline and generated stable revenue forecasts. The combined analysis illustrates 
both cross-sectional insights (product relationships) and temporal behavior (sales trends).

Future work may include multi-level itemset mining, FP-growth, Holt–Winters smoothing, 
and ARIMA models.
