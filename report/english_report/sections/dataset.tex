\section{Dataset Description}

The dataset used in this project consists of detailed invoice-level transaction records 
from a UK-based online retail store. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a single 
purchased item within an invoice, providing a granular view of purchasing behavior 
across thousands of customers and products.

The primary attributes include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{InvoiceNo}: Unique transaction identifier,
	\item \textbf{Description}: Product name,
	\item \textbf{Quantity}: Number of units purchased,
	\item \textbf{UnitPrice}: Price per individual item,
	\item \textbf{InvoiceDate}: Timestamp of transaction,
	\item \textbf{CustomerID}: Unique customer code,
	\item \textbf{Country}: Country from which the purchase was made.
\end{itemize}

This dataset is widely recognized for research in market basket analysis and demand forecasting. 
Its structure—consisting of rich transaction-level detail, temporal coverage of one full year, 
and a diverse set of products—makes it highly suitable for the methods applied in this report.
