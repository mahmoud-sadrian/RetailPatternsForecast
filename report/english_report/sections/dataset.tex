\section{Dataset Description}

The dataset contains retail transactions, where each row represents a purchased item 
within an invoice. The primary attributes include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{InvoiceNo:} Unique invoice identifier,
	\item \textbf{Description:} Product name,
	\item \textbf{Quantity:} Number of purchased units,
	\item \textbf{UnitPrice:} Price per unit,
	\item \textbf{InvoiceDate:} Timestamp,
	\item \textbf{CustomerID:} Customer identifier,
	\item \textbf{Country:} Country of sale.
\end{itemize}

An additional attribute \textbf{TotalAmount} is computed:
\[
\text{TotalAmount} = \text{Quantity} \times \text{UnitPrice}.
\]

This processed dataset is then used for both association rule mining 
(transaction-level analysis) and revenue forecasting (time series aggregation).
