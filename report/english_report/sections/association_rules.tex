\section{Association Rule Mining (Manual Implementation)}

\subsection{Support, Confidence, and Lift}

For itemset \( X \):
\[
\text{support}(X)
= \frac{\text{transactions containing } X}{N}.
\]

For rule \( X \rightarrow Y \):
\[
\text{confidence}(X \rightarrow Y)
= \frac{\text{support}(X \cup Y)}{\text{support}(X)}.
\]

\[
\text{lift}(X \rightarrow Y)
= \frac{\text{confidence}(X \rightarrow Y)}{\text{support}(Y)}.
\]

\subsection{Frequent Itemsets}

Only 1-item and 2-item itemsets were computed manually using NumPy Boolean operations 
for efficiency. The top frequent itemsets display strong co-occurrence patterns 
consistent with high-volume retail items.

\subsection{Extracted Rules}

\end{figure}

Example rules include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \{A\} $\rightarrow$ \{B\} with high confidence,
	\item \{C\} $\rightarrow$ \{D\} with moderate lift.
\end{itemize}

These rules reveal meaningful relationships between frequently co-purchased items.
