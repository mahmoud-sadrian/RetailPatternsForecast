\section{Introduction}

Retail transaction datasets provide an ideal foundation for extracting actionable 
insights about customer behavior. Two of the most widely used techniques in this domain 
are association rule mining---used to discover co-occurrence patterns among products---and 
time series forecasting, which supports revenue prediction and inventory planning.

This project focuses on implementing both tasks \textbf{from scratch}. 
We manually construct the basket matrix, compute support, confidence, and lift without 
external packages, and implement a simplified Apriori algorithm for one- and two-item 
frequent itemsets. Furthermore, we develop a manual Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) 
model to forecast daily revenue.

This dual analysis provides a complete view of both cross-sectional patterns 
(product co-occurrence) and temporal behavior (revenue evolution).
