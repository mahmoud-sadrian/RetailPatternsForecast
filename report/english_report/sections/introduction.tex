\section{Introduction}

Retail transaction datasets offer valuable opportunities for analyzing customer behavior, 
product co-occurrence patterns, and temporal sales trends. This project focuses on the 
manual implementation of two core data mining tasks: association rule mining and 
time series forecasting. By avoiding external machine learning libraries and relying only 
on fundamental vectorized operations, the workflow provides complete transparency in how 
frequent itemsets, support, confidence, lift, and forecasting metrics are computed.

The analysis is conducted using the publicly available 
\href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail}{Online Retail dataset}
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset provides one year of detailed 
invoice-level transactions from a UK-based online store and is widely used in 
market basket analysis and forecasting research.

Its structure enables both cross-sectional analysis (frequent product combinations) 
and temporal analysis (daily revenue patterns), forming a complete framework for 
retail analytics.
