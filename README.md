# 🛒 Association Rule Mining & Time Series Forecasting 

### Data Mining – Homework 1

This repository contains a complete data mining project involving **manual implementation** of:

- Association Rule Mining (support, confidence, lift)
- Frequent itemsets (1-item & 2-item) without external libraries
- Market Basket Analysis using a binary invoice–product matrix
- Daily Revenue Time Series + manual Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots
- A full academic LaTeX report

Dataset used:  
**[Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
